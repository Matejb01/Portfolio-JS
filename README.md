# Portfolio-JS
This is my portfolio which consists of 16 projects that I've done in the Udemy course "JavaScript Master Class for 2022 with HTML and CSS". 
When you click on the "Show Projects" button you can see all the projects on the right, and those are: 
- Time App
- Tip Calculator
- Color Psychology
- Password generator
- Breaking Bad quotes
- Meditation
- Memory game
- Tic Tac Toe
- Whack a mole
- Game Settings
- Inspirational Quote
- Random joke generator
- Pokedex
- Crud Store
- Battle game

Some of these were completely built from scratch and for some I got the code that had some bugs which I needed to fix or I got half the code and had to write the rest myself.
